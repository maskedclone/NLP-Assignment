Through this paper, the author proposes a new way to learn the neural network classifier for use in the forward-based, greedy-based dependency parser, and the author's parser can parse parses over 1000 sentences per second with 92.2% unlabeled attachment points on English Penn Treebank.The neural network learns compact dense vector representations of words, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and dependency labels. The results show that the parser outperforms other greedy parsers using sparse indicator features in both accuracy and speed.

Inspired by recent successes of distributed word representations in many NLP tasks, e.g. POS tagging, machine translation, and election parsing.The neural network learns compact dense vector representations of words, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and dependency labels. The results show that the parser outperforms other greedy parsers using sparse indicator features in both accuracy and speed.
