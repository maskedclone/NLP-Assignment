| Problem   | It can be challenging for a new participant to understand the previous chatting log due to multi-party dialogues always exhibit disorder and complication (for example: consistency and continuity are broken by tangled reply-to dependencies between non-adjacent utterances). In other word, there are little attentions that paid to the characteristics of dialogues |
| Key Related Work | Providing contextualized backbones with Pre-trained Language Models (PrLMs). <br /> Early works in Dialogue Disentanglement can be summarized as feature encoder and clustering algorithms to predict whether a pair of utterances are alike or different. <br /> Then end-to-end approach is proposed by mapping the states of each dialogue thread with clustered utterances |
