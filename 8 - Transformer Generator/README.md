# NLP Lab7 - Translation

### The original dataset is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/en-fr-translation-dataset. The reason why I used French is that there are many special characters in my own language Vietnamese.

### My coding part is motivated from our classmates Todsavad, Tonson and Ati as well as Sandhya, Sirikit and AnhNguyen. And of course, fully referenced on our Professor's code.
### My website outline is greatly inspired by Anh Nguyen.
